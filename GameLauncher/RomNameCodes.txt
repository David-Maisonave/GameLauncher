Miscelaneous:
(Proto)                 - Prototype cartridge. This is an unfinished build of a game.
(Beta)                  - Beta cartridge. This is an unfinished build of a game.
(V1.0), (V1.1), etc     - Version number.
(REV00), (REV01), etc   - Revision number.   
(PRG0), (PRG1), etc     - Revision number.   
[a1], [a2], etc         - Alternate version. Another acceptable dump.
[f1], [f2], etc         - Fixed. Edited (cracked) to work in emulators.
[h1], [h2], etc         - Hack. Something about this cartridge has been changed, probably by pirates. The change is likely not noticeable.
[h1C], [h2C], etc       - Hack. Something about this cartridge has been changed, definitly by Chinese pirates.
[p1], [p2], etc         - Pirate version. The pirates changed something about the cartridge. Likely a simple removal of copywrites or a multipack.
[t1], [t2], etc         - Trained. The ROM has been edited to alter stats or other gameplay mechanics.
[o1], [o2], etc         - Overdump. Lots of extra data on the end, which is likely garbage.
[b1], [b2], etc         - Bad dump. You almost certainly don't want to download this.
[hI]                    - Intro hack.
(MP)                    - Mega Play.
[c]                     - Checksum.
[x]                     - Bad checksum.
[T+language_name]       - Translation + language translated to _ transator.
[hI]                    - Has screen added to the beggining of the ROM!

Notes:
[o1] or [b1] tags mean that the ROM is essentially garbage.
Bad checksums ([x]) aren't nessisarily bad; a good dump of Dynamite Heddy has a bad checksum.
